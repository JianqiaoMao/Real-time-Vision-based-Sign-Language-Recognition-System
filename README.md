# Vision-based-Sign-Language-Recognition-System
My undergraduate Final Year Project awarded as the Excellent Bachelor's Project. It develops a vision-based sign language recognition system with multiple machine-learning models, which currently can recognize 10 static and 2 dynamic gesutures in ASL with testing accuracy of 99.68%.
