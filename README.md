# Vision-based-Sign-Language-Recognition-System
My undergraduate Final Year Project awarded as the Excellent Bachelor's Project. It develops a vision-based sign language recognition system with multiple machine-learning models, which currently can recognize 10 static and 2 dynamic gesutures in ASL with testing accuracy of 99.68%. 

The codes are classified into 6 parts according to the process partition, i.e. data acquisition, preprocessing, dataset preparation, pre-classification model training and testing, classification models training and testing, final system with pre-trained models.

The dataset is not available for public use at this stage.
